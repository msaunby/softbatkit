Software Bat Toolkit
--------------------


Experimenters tools
-------------------
These tools are for fellow bat detector designers and other ultrasonic hardware hackers.  With these it is possible to test
ultrasonic capabilities of sound cards. Once you know you have a sound card capable of recording and/or playing ultra sound
these tools can then be used for tesing other hardware.

Software heterodyne bat detector
--------------------------------
If you have a soundcard capable of recording ultra sound this applicaton can emulate a heterodyne bat detector. With it
you can convert ultra sonic sounds in the range 15kHz to 95kHz (with a 192k sound card) into audible tones.

High speed ultrasound audio recorder
------------------------------------
With the addition of some inexpensive home built hardware it is possible to use a PC running this software into a high
speed ultrasonic recorder.
